# Assignment 1: User admin, Login, Register, and Profile
Here you will find code building a simple User login functionality for a course
manager site named Whiteboard. The stack is HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, JS for client side,
AJAX for web service, and Java/SQL for server side data handling using the Java
Persistence Library.

The web app is hosted by Heroku and can be found
[here](https://eh-cs4550-summer2-2018.herokuapp.com/jquery/register/register.template.client.html)

Hope you enjoy and more is to come with future React and Node implementation.
